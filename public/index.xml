      <guid>http://localhost:1314/privacy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;privacy-statement&#34;&gt;Privacy Statement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at NewPush are concerned about and are committed to protecting the privacy of you, our web site visitors. To that end, we have established this Privacy Policy as our commitment to maintain the privacy of your personal information in connection with all our online and Internet activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about ‘NewPush’, ‘we’, ‘our’ or ‘us’ in this notice, we are referring to TheNewPush, LLC. and its group companies, including NewPush Europe Kft. When we say ‘you’ or ‘End-User’ in this notice, we mean any individual using and accessing our services. When we talk about an ‘Organization’ or ‘Customer’ in this notice, we are generally referring to the entity of which you are an employee, contractor, member, or another participant, that has engaged us to provide the services under the terms of a contract. The ‘Organization Administrators’ we talk about in this notice are the individuals authorized by our Customers to help administer our services internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-privacy-principles&#34;&gt;Our Privacy Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust and transparency are foundational to what we do at NewPush. We are committed to being open about how we approach privacy, and aim to communicate with you about privacy in a way that is easy for you to understand. To support these goals, we developed these Privacy Principles to highlight our commitment to responsibly protecting and handling your personal information. Our Privacy Principles help guide decisions we make at every level of our organization, every day so that we can fulfill our mission to democratize security in a way that is consistent with our core values as well as our legal obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-core-privacy-principles-are&#34;&gt;Our core Privacy Principles are:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We respect individuals’ privacy by promoting informed choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We collect only the personal information we need, and get rid of what we don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are transparent about how we use personal information and accountable for how we and our partners use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We factor security into everything we do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We engineer privacy into our ideas and products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-of-personal-information&#34;&gt;Use of Personal Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may gather information about you through our web site in three ways. First, we may collect and store some personally identifiable information (such as your name, telephone number, and e-mail address) that you provide to us through surveys, job applications, contests, service orders, or inquiries on this site. Second, we may collect and store information about your visit to this site in collective or aggregated data that does not identify you specifically. Third, we may collect and store information through the use of “cookies.” The term “cookies” refers to lines of text that are transmitted to your web browser when you click on a site, providing a way for a server to recall a previous request or previous registration, or keep track of a transaction as it progresses, so that information does not have to be repeated. We use all of this information to help maintain accurate accounts, to provide and to change services, to provide accurate billing and shipping, to answer your inquiries, to market services and products, and to help make our web site useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-we-use-the-information-we-collect&#34;&gt;How we use the information we collect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, we use the personal information we collect to operate our business and provide our services, which includes using data to improve, research and develop our product offerings and to personalize your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may use the personal information we collect through the services for a range of reasons, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to provide and maintain the services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to manage your Organization’s or your account with us, including for billing purposes as well as for our customer relationship management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to personalize the services and improve your experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to improve our products, technology and services, and, where you have agreed, to provide you updates on how we are improving the services based on any feedback you might have given.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to analyze your use of the services in order to ensure the technical functionality of our products, technology and services, and to research and develop new products and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to prevent, detect, respond and protect against potential or actual claims, liabilities, prohibited behavior and criminal activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, agreements and policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to perform other activities consistent with this notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-information&#34;&gt;Sharing Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information that we obtain from you is generally necessary for us to provide your services and to design new services for your future use. As a general rule, NewPush will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties personal information gathered online about you without your consent. The only exceptions to this rule are: (i) when we work with affiliated businesses, partners, or agents to develop a relationship with you or to perform services for you on our behalf or (ii) as may be required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process or in the case of imminent physical harm to you or others. In the case of (i) above, we require the relevant businesses, partners, or agents to adhere to our policies regarding the use and protection of your personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-we-keep-your-personal-information-secure&#34;&gt;How we keep your personal information secure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take the security of the personal information we have about you very seriously. We use appropriate administrative, organizational, technical and physical safeguards that are designed to protect the personal information we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and to help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those with authorized access (as decided by your Organization Administrator or you, as appropriate). However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so you should take care in deciding what information you send us in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;international-data-transfers&#34;&gt;International data transfers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are headquartered in the United States and operate internationally. Therefore, you should be aware that we may transfer or process your personal information in countries other than the country in which you are a resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws of your country, and in some cases may not be as protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, our Website servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and third party service providers, including Amazon, Arisant, Google, Handy Networks, IBM, Microsoft, and partners, operate in the United States and in other countries around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any number of places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever your personal information is transferred, stored or processed by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information as indicated in this Notice. Additionally, when using or disclosing personal information transferred from the European Economic Area, we use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, adopt other means under applicable law for ensuring adequate safeguards or obtain your consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-long-we-keep-your-personal-information&#34;&gt;How long we keep your personal information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only keep your personal information for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Notice, to provide the services or to comply with legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or to comply with our legal obligations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it. If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;e-mail-communication&#34;&gt;E-mail Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NewPush and our affiliated businesses, partners, and agents may use e-mail to communicate to our customers, respond to visitors’ e-mails, or to inform you about events or new products. We will not send commercial solicitation via e-mail to you if you request that it not be sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;children&#34;&gt;Children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not market to or collect personal information about children under 18 years of age at this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modifications&#34;&gt;Modifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NewPush reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice in NewPush’s sole discretion. Such modifications shall be effective when posted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LLM-Based Assistive Recommendation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1314/event/llm/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1314/event/llm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for natural language understanding and generation. What if we power recommender systems with LLMs that can reason through user activities on the platform, and can help plan recommendations accordingly? Equipped with UXR insights that people use nuanced language to describe their long-term interest journeys, and they want more user agency in their recommender platforms, we pinpoint a combination of LLMs and personalization as a key ingredient for the next generation of assistive recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sparsity In Deep Neural Nets</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1314/event/on-device-llm/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1314/event/on-device-llm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the attention of the tech world with their remarkable common-sense reasoning and generalizability. However, their large size and server transfer requirements can make them resource-intensive and slow, which is problematic for use in mobile or wearable devices like smart glasses and smart watches. Moreover, on-device computing could offer a solution to privacy concerns by keeping sensitive data, such as text messages or photos, on the device itself. To tackle these challenges, we’ve developed a more compact language model, ranging from 0.5B to 1.4B parameters. This model is designed to run on-device, providing a competitive performance for conversational grounded tasks, while also managing latency and memory usage effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
