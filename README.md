# Project Name

This is the website of the 25th anniversary symposium.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (only if you plan to build Hugo from source).
- You have a Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS) or Windows.

## Installation

To install Hugo, follow these steps:

### Install Hugo on MacOS

```sh
brew install hugo
```


## Running Hugo Locally

To run Hugo and serve the website locally for development, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command to start the Hugo development server:

   ```sh
   hugo serve -D
   ```

   The `-D` flag includes draft content.

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:1313` to view the website.

4. Hugo will automatically reload the page when you make changes to your content files.

5. To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
