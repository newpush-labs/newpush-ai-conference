He pursues Responsible AI adoption for the public interest and passionately builds strategic bridges between the Tech industry, startups, policy, the social sector, and academia. He advises and leads on #ResponsibleAI strategy, governance, policy, ethics, talent, and impact, as well as systemic innovation strategy, AI-driven product and business model innovation, digital and cultural transformations, and ecosystem-building. He has consistently demonstrated his success in delivering complex programs and solutions in accelerated timelines, as he did at Microsoft, Ipsos, Experfy, and in his book BetweenBrains. Dr. Tilesch is driven by a public interest mindset to steer the direction of AI development and proliferation, as well as craft a comprehensive AI toolset that ultimately serves the benefit of all humankind.
